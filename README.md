# NMGunerâ€™s dotfiles

Personal configuration for setting up a MacOS system including the dotfiles, tools and applications.

## Installation

Firstly, clone the repository and review the contents and configuration in order to adjust to your liking. Following that, run the install script;

./bootstrap.sh
```
### Updating dotfiles

After the initial installation, making changes in the files inside `dotfiles` directory and executing `dotfiles.sh` will update the files in home directory.

### Other scripts

There are certain shell scripts here that setup more than just dotfiles in home directory such as `android.sh`, `asdf.sh` and so on. These can be used to update setup confiurations for the associated tools or system settings.
